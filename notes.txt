Card borders are no longer colored by subject.
Favorites page: 
 *   Card needs all headers and data
 *   Card needs favorites stars and ability to remove card from favorites

    User needs ability to include different lists other than favorites (Possibly openers, closers, etc...)


    Stars on /all page should toggle immediately when clicked.  Currently if highlighted already, they stay highlighted if clicked (just a different highlight).  If not highlighted, they should be highlighted immediately when clicked. 

    Will update config.json with appropriate passwords once in production.  Just Testing ATM.
